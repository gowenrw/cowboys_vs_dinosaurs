## Badge bumper

The badge bumper is a simple 3d print that sandwiches between the two PCBs. It is designed to press onto the standoff nuts to keep it in place.

This bumper provides a few useful features:
- Prevents things from dropping into the well of the badge
- When printed with a translucent material, allows for diffusion of the LED lights

When printing, we currently recommend a low infill, around 5%, and a recilinear infill or similar geometry as opposed to infill such as Gyroidal which will diffuse too much light internally.

We do not have specific print settings for this, but the part is designed to print as easily as possible.
